Data transforms
mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
why need this?


1. How to load the data:
	Load images from folder, info from .extension file
	Split data into training set, validation set
	
	Plot random image
	data augmentation
2. Create model base on the previous model
	Transfer learning load the model
	from torchvision import models


3. Training and Fine Turning and choose the best parameters with that model

4. Test accuracy on test set

Visualizing Output:
